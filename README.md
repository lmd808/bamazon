# bamazon
Better than Amazon
# Why? 
Bamazon allows customers and managers(almost there) to interact with a store. Customers can search and buy products which are saved in a database. If the stock is too low to fullfil their order then the order they will recieve an alert and will not be able to order said item. 

Manager will be able to see all products (done), add inventory(done), view low stock(under construction), and add products(under construction). 

# Structure

## Customer
When the program is called this will load a table of products. 
The customer will then be prompted to select an item to purchase. 
After the customer will be prompted to select the stock qty they want. 

If they want more than what is in stock they will be prompted to start over. 
## Manager 
WHen the program is called the bamazonManager file will prompted the user with 5 choices: ('VIEW PRODUCTS FOR SALE', 'VIEW LOW INVENTORY', 'ADD TO INVENTORY', 'ADD NEW PRODUCT', 'EXIT'). The choice will being the user through a series of prompts. if the process is successful it will restart the program.
